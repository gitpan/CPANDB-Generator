=head1 NAME

CPANDB::Generator - Generator module for the CPAN Index Database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Simplicity itself
  CPANDB::Generator->new->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a module used to generate a unified index database, pulling in
data from various other sources to produce a single schema that contains
the essential elements from all of them.

It is uploaded to the CPAN for the purpose of full disclosure, or in case
the author gets hit by a bus. Generating the index database involves
downloading a number of relatively large SQLite datasets, the consumption
of several gigabytes of disk, and a fairly large amount of CPU time.

If you are interested in using the index database, you should
instead see the L<CPANDB> distribution.

# Constructor

=pod

=head2 new

  my $cpan = CPANDB::Generator->new(
      cpan   => '/root/.cpan',
      sqlite => '/root/CPANDB.sqlite',
  );

Creates a new generation object.

The optional C<cpan> param identifies the path to your
cpan operating directory. By default, a fresh one will be
generated in a temporary directory, and deleted at the end of
the generation run.

The optional C<sqlite> param specifies where the SQLite database
should be written to. By default, this will be to a standard
location in your home directory.

Returns a new B<CPANDB::Generator> object.

=cut

sub new {
	my $self = shift->SUPER::new(@_);

	# Default the CPAN path to a temp directory,
	# so that we don't disturb any existing files.
	unless ( defined $self->cpan ) {
		$self->{cpan} = File::Temp::tempdir( CLEANUP => 1 );
	}

	# Establish where we will be writing to
	unless ( defined $self->sqlite ) {
		$self->{sqlite} = File::Spec->catdir(
			File::HomeDir->my_data,
			($^O eq 'MSWin32' ? 'Perl' : '.perl'),
			'CPANDB-Generator',
			'cpan.db',
		);
	}

	# Set the default path to the publishing location
	unless ( exists $self->{publish} ) {
		$self->{publish} = 'cpan';
	}

	# If we have a minicpan and no urllist,
	# derive the latter from the former.
	if ( $self->minicpan and not $self->urllist ) {
		my $uri = URI::file->new( $self->minicpan, undef )->as_string;
		unless ( $uri =~ m/\/\z/ ) {
			$uri .= '/';
		}	
		$self->{urllist} = [ $uri ];
	}

	return $self;
}

=pod

=head2 dir

The C<dir> method returns the directory that the SQLite
database will be written into.

=cut

sub dir {
	File::Basename::dirname($_[0]->sqlite);
}

=pod

=head2 dsn

The C<dsn> method returns the L<DBI> DSN that is used to connect
to the generated database.

=cut

sub dsn {
	"DBI:SQLite:" . $_[0]->sqlite
}

=pod

=head2 cpan_sql

Once it has been fetched or updated from your CPAN mirror, the
C<cpan_sql> method returns the location of the L<CPAN::SQLite>
database used by the CPAN client.

This database is used as the source of the information that forms
the core of the unified index database, and that the rest of the
data will be decorated around.

=cut

sub cpan_sql {
	File::Spec->catfile($_[0]->cpan, 'cpandb.sql');
